jd="""Soware Engineering Intern, Summer 2025 - Bangalore or Hyderabad or Pune
The area: Engineering & Operations
Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of
technical skills who are ready to tackle some of technology's greatest challenges and make
an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize
search, they routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale
applications and entirely new plaorms for developers around the world. From AdWords to
Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one
technological achievement aer another.
Role Description
Soware Engineering interns at Google are researchers and developers who yearn to create
and implement complex computer science solutions. Our engineers develop massively
scalable, distributed soware systems and also collaborate on multitudes of smaller projects
that have universal appeal - which requires research, awareness, interactivity, and asking
questions. You build strong competencies in data structures and algorithms, along with a
technical fascination for how stu ts together. You need to have a solid foundation in
computer science in order to consistently come up with new ideas as well as strive for a deep
understanding of our products and services in order to continually improve upon them. We
focus on being a collaborative, global organization consisting of engineers with the highest
levels of technical depth, programming skills and a keen eye for quality.
As a Soware Engineer intern, you will work on our core products and services as well as those
who support critical functions of our engineering operations. Depending on your background
and experience, you will be working in one of the following areas:
Product and Systems Development
Whether it's nding new and innovative ways to advance search quality, building computing
plaorm and networking technologies, automating the indexing of videos, or continuing to
rene and scale complex auction systems (just to name a few), you will be developing
solutions to some of the most challenging technical problems out there. You will research,
conceive and develop soware applications to extend and improve on Google's product
oerings and collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data
and information. Examples of specialist domains: UI development with AJAX and similar
technologies, security, embedded systems and mobile apps (Android), developer tools (IDEs,
large-scale build systems, compilers).
Engineering Productivity
In this organization, you'll use your soware design, analysis and programming skills to
create innovative automated test systems. This isn't a job in which you'll simply debug and
run test cases, in fact that only scratches the surface. The test team undertakes a broad
range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can
explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just
imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never
been done before. There are no textbooks that can help you learn this, which is why we have
some of the best and brightest engineers working in this group.
