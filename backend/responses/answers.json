        "question": "1. Can you elaborate on the technical challenges you faced while developing the CashLedger Android Application and how you overcame them, particularly with Firebase integration?",
        "answer": "During development, Firebase real-time data synchronization and offline access were key challenges. I resolved them by optimizing Firestore queries with proper indexing, implementing offline persistence, and using transaction-based updates to ensure data consistency."

        "question": "2. In the Dummy Faculty Recruitment Portal project, how did you ensure data security and integrity, especially given the sensitive nature of the information being handled?",
        "answer": "Security measures included role-based access control (RBAC), encrypted database fields, and secure API endpoints with JWT authentication. Regular audits and input validation were also implemented to prevent SQL injection and data leaks."

        "question": "3. For the CarDash Game, could you discuss the process you used for VGA graphics rendering and how you optimized the game's performance on the ARM-DE1SoC board?",
        "answer": "The game used direct hardware rendering via VGA buffers, with sprite optimizations and frame-rate control. To enhance performance, I minimized memory usage through efficient asset loading and implemented fixed-point arithmetic for faster calculations on the ARM processor."
